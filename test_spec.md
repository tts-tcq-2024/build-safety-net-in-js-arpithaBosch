Test Specification Document for Soundex Algorithm.

This document outlines the test cases designed to validate the Soundex algorithm's functionality. The Soundex algorithm is used to encode names into a four-character code based on their pronunciation, making it useful for matching names despite minor differences in spelling. The tests cover a range of input scenarios, including valid and invalid names, edge cases, and special cases, to ensure the algorithm behaves as expected. The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive testing strategy, ensuring that all aspects of the Soundex algorithm have been thoroughly verified.																	                                   													                                                                 
Test Case ID	Purpose	Description	Input	Expected output
TC001	Function handles empty strings	When given an empty string, the output must pad with zeros to ensure the length is 4 characters.	""	"0000"
				
TC002	Function handles single characters	When a single character string is given, the output must return the first letter padded with zeros to ensure the length is 4 characters.	"A"	"A000"
			"B"	"B000"
				
TC003	Function handles words with vowels and consonants	When a word containing both vowels and consonants is given, the function must ignore vowels and certain consonants('w', 'h'). The output should begin with the first letter of the word, followed by the corresponding Soundex codes of the remaining valid consonants, and be padded with zeros if necessary to ensure the code has 4 characters.	"Art"	"A630"
			"Robert"	"R163"
			"Aeiou"	"A000"
			"Abeioucd"	"A123"
				
				
				
				
TC004	Function should handle Duplicate Consonants	Duplicate consonants should be treated as a single occurrence in the Soundex code. Only the first instance is encoded, and subsequent identical consonants are ignored.	"Hello"	"H400"
			"Tennessee"	"T520"
				
				
				
				
TC005	Function should handle words with mixed cases correctly	The function should handle words with mixed upper and lower cases by treating them the same, producing the correct Soundex code. Case differences should not affect the output.	"McDonald"	"M235"
				
				
				
				
TC006	Function should ignore special characters 	Special characters should be ignored during encoding, and the Soundex code should only include valid consonants.	"Anne-Marie"	"A556"
			"John123!@#"	"J500"
				
				
TC007	Function should produce the same Soundex code for names with similar sounds	Names with similar sounds but different spellings should result in the same Soundex code, as Soundex focuses on phonetic similarity.	"Jackson"	"J250"
			"Jaxon"	"J250"
				
				
TC008	Function should correctly handle string with multiple words	When a name consists of multiple words, only the first word should be encoded, and the remaining words should be ignored.	"Alexander Grahambell"	"A425"
				
				
TC009	Function should ignore numerical digits and special characters in the names	Numerical digits should be ignored when encoding the name. 	"1234"	"0000"
			"2Krishh45"	"K620"
				
TC010	Function should correctly handle names with leading and trailing spaces with/without special characters.	Leading and trailing spaces should be ignored when processing the name. The Soundex code should be based solely on valid alphabetic characters.	"  Rita  "	R300
			"   "Kripa"   "	K610
			  "     O'Connor Smith"	O256
